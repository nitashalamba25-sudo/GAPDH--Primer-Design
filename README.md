# GAPDH--Primer-Design
In-silico design and specificity analysis of GAPDH PCR Primers using NCBI Primer Blast
 Activity 1: Virtual Design and Specificity Testing of GAPDH PCR Primers

Objective

The aim of this activity was to design specific PCR primers for the human GAPDH gene and evaluate their quality and specificity using NCBI Primer-BLAST.

Target Gene Information-

- Gene Name:GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase)
- Organism:Homo sapiens
- Gene ID:2597
- mRNA Accession:NM_002046.7
- Chromosome:12

Tools Used-
NCBI Gene Database
NCBI Nucleotide Database
NCBI Primer-BLAST

 Methodology-
- The GAPDH mRNA sequence (NM_002046.7) was retrieved from the NCBI Nucleotide database.
- The FASTA sequence was used as input in Primer-BLAST.

Primer design parameters were set as follows:
1) Product size range: 70–200 bp
2) Melting temperature (Tm): 57–63°C
3) Primers spanning exon–exon junction to avoid genomic DNA amplification.
4) Primer specificity was checked against the human genome (Homo sapiens).
5) Primer quality was evaluated based on Tm, GC content, self-complementarity, and product size.

Selected Primer Pair (Primer Pair 1)

Forward Primer (5' → 3')-
TCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT

Reverse Primer (5' → 3')-
TTCCCGTTCTCAGCCTTGAC

| Parameter               | Forward Primer | Reverse Primer |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Length                  | 20 bp          | 20 bp          |
| Tm                      | 59.32 °C       | 59.97 °C       |
| GC Content              | 50%            | 55%            |
| Self-Complementarity    | 3.0            | 3.0            |
| 3′ Self-Complementarity | 1.0            | 1.0            |

Expected PCR Product Size: 181 bp

Specificity Analysis-

Primer-BLAST results showed that the selected primer pair successfully amplifies the GAPDH gene with high specificity. Although amplification was also observed in different transcript variants of GAPDH, no significant off-target amplification was detected elsewhere in the human genome.

Conclusion-

- The designed primer pair demonstrates:
- Optimal Tm and GC content
- Low self-complementarity (minimal primer-dimer risk)
- Specific amplification of the human GAPDH gene
Therefore, this primer pair is suitable for PCR/qPCR applications.
